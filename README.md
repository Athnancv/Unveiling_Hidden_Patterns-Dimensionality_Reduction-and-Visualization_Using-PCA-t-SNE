# Unveiling_Hidden_Patterns-Dimensionality_Reduction-and-Visualization_Using-PCA-t-SNE
High-dimensional datasets often contain valuable information hidden within complex relationships among features. This project aims to uncover those hidden patterns using two powerful dimensionality reduction techniques â€” Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).
